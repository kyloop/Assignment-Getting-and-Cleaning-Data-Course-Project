## Getting and Cleaning Course Project
*The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.*

## Steps to create one R script called run_analysis.R 
*1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.*

*2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.*

*3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.*

*4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.*

*5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.*

## Steps to work on the project
*a.Download the project details and files from the link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip*
*b.Create a script which is called run_analysis.R to read/load files to R. Script also average out each variable for each activity and each subject and create a table for it.*
